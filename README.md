# 🎥 MatrixRTC Authorization Service

The **MatrixRTC Authorization Service** bridges Matrix and LiveKit, handling
authentication and room creation when needed.

## 💡 TL;DR

Matrix user wants to start or join a call?

👤 ➡️ Gets OpenID token ➡️ Sends it to the **MatrixRTC Authorization Service** ➡️
Receives LiveKit JWT ➡️

- **If full-access user** ➡️ Can trigger LiveKit room creation (if needed) ➡️
  Joins the call 🎉
- **If restricted user** ➡️ Can join existing rooms ➡️ Joins the call 🎉

📡 Once connected, the LiveKit SFU handles all real-time media routing so
participants can see and hear each other.

</p>

## 📌 When to Use

This service is part of the **MatrixRTC stack** and is primarily used when the
[LiveKit RTC backend (MSC4195)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4195)
is in use.

As outlined in the
[Element Call Self-Hosting Guide](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/blob/livekit/docs/self-hosting.md),
you’ll also need:

- A [LiveKit SFU](https://github.com/livekit/livekit)
- MatrixRTC-compatible clients such as
  [Element Call](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call), which can run
  either:
  - As a standalone Single Page Application (SPA) or
  - Embedded for in-app calling

## ✨ What It Does

🔑 **Generates JWT tokens** for a given LiveKit identity and room derived from
the Matrix user and Matrix room, allowing users to authenticate with the LiveKit
SFU.

🛡️ **Manages user access levels** to ensure the proper and secure use of
infrastructure:

- **Full-access users** — Matrix users from homeservers in the same or related
  deployment as the MatrixRTC backend. Can trigger automatic LiveKit room
  creation if needed.
- **Restricted users** — All other Matrix users. Can join existing LiveKit SFU
  rooms, but cannot auto-create new ones.

🏗️ **Auto-creates LiveKit rooms** for full-access users if they don’t already
exist.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup ensures resources are used appropriately while still supporting
> seamless cross-federation MatrixRTC sessions, e.g., video calls. Remote users
> (not on the same deployment) can join existing rooms, but only full-access
> (local) users can trigger room creation. The SFU selection algorithm and event
> ordering ensure that conferences across Matrix federation remain fully
> functional.

## 🗺️ How It Works — Token Exchange Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as 🧑 User
    participant M as 🏢 Matrix Homeserver
    participant A as 🔐 MatrixRTC Authorization Service
    participant L as 📡 LiveKit SFU

    U->>M: Requests OpenID token
    M-->>U: Returns OpenID token
    U->>A: Sends OpenID token & room request
    A->>M: Validates token via OpenID API
    M-->>A: Confirms user identity
    A->>A: Generates LiveKit JWT
    A->>L: (If full-access user) Create room if missing
    A-->>U: Returns LiveKit JWT
    U->>L: Connects to room using JWT
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Set environment variables to configure the service:

| Variable                                      | Description                                                        | Required                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LIVEKIT_URL`                                 | WebSocket URL of the LiveKit SFU                                   | ✅ Yes                                                       |
| `LIVEKIT_KEY` / `LIVEKIT_KEY_FROM_FILE`       | API key or file path for LiveKit SFU                               | ✅ Yes                                                       |
| `LIVEKIT_SECRET` / `LIVEKIT_SECRET_FROM_FILE` | API secret or file path for LiveKit SFU                            | ✅ Yes                                                       |
| `LIVEKIT_KEY_FILE`                            | File path with `APIkey: secret` format                             | ⚠️ mutually exclusive with `LIVEKIT_KEY` and `LIVEKIT_SECRET` |
| `LIVEKIT_JWT_PORT`                            | Port to listen on (default: `8080`)                                | ❌ No                                                        |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, the LiveKit SFU auto-creates rooms for all users. To ensure proper
> access control, update your LiveKit
> [config.yaml](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/blob/7350e9933107ecdea4ada8f8bcb0d6ca78b3f8f7/config-sample.yaml#L170)
> to **disable automatic room creation**.

**LiveKit SFU config should include:**

```yaml
room:
  auto_create: false
```

## 🔒 Transport Layer Security (TLS) Setup Using a Reverse Proxy

To properly secure the MatrixRTC Authorization Service, a reverse proxy is
recommended.

### Example Caddy Config

```caddy
matrix-rtc.domain.tld {
    bind xx.xx.xx.xx

    handle /livekit/jwt* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:8080
    }
}
```

### Example Nginx Config

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name matrix-rtc.domain.tld;

    # Redirect HTTP → HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name matrix-rtc.domain.tld;

    # TLS certificate paths (replace with your own)
    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/matrix-rtc.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/matrix-rtc.key;

    # TLS settings (minimal)
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    location /livekit/jwt/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## 📌 Do Not Forget to Update Your Matrix Site's `.well-known/matrix/client`

For proper MatrixRTC functionality, you need to configure your site's
`.well-known/matrix/client`. See the
[Element Call self-hosting guide](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/blob/livekit/docs/self-hosting.md#matrixrtc-backend-announcement)
for reference.

The following key must be included in
`https://domain.tld/.well-known/matrix/client`:

```json
"org.matrix.msc4143.rtc_foci": [
    {
        "type": "livekit",
        "livekit_service_url": "https://matrix-rtc.domain.tld/livekit/jwt"
    }
]
```

## 🧪 Development & Testing

### Disable TLS verification

For testing and debugging (e.g. in the absence of trusted certificates while
testing in a lab), you can disable TLS verification for the outgoing connection
to the Matrix homeserver by setting the environment variable
`LIVEKIT_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY_TLS` to `YES_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING`.

### 🛠️ Development Environment (Docker Compose)

Based on the
[Element Call GitHub repo](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call)

The easiest way to spin up the full Matrix stack is by using the development
environment provided by Element Call. For detailed instructions, see
[Element Call Backend Setup](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call?tab=readme-ov-file#backend).

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure your local frontend works properly, you need to add certificate
> exceptions in your browser for:
>
> - `https://localhost:3000`
> - `https://matrix-rtc.m.localhost/livekit/jwt/healthz`
> - `https://synapse.m.localhost/.well-known/matrix/client`
>
> You can do this either by adding the minimal m.localhost CA
> ([dev_tls_m.localhost.crt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/element-hq/element-call/refs/heads/livekit/backend/dev_tls_m.localhost.crt))
> to your browser’s trusted certificates, or by visiting each URL in your
> browser and following the prompts to accept the exception.

#### 🐳 Start MatrixRTC stack without the MatrixRTC Authorization Service

```sh
git clone https://github.com/element-hq/element-call.git
cd element-call
docker-compose -f ./dev-backend-docker-compose.yml -f ./playwright-backend-docker-compose.override.yml up nginx livekit synapse redis
```

#### 🔑 Start the MatrixRTC Authorization Service locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/element-hq/lk-jwt-service
cd lk-jwt-service
LIVEKIT_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY_TLS="YES_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING" \
LIVEKIT_URL="wss://matrix-rtc.m.localhost/livekit/sfu" \
LIVEKIT_KEY=devkey \
LIVEKIT_SECRET=secret \
LIVEKIT_JWT_PORT=6080 \
LIVEKIT_LOCAL_HOMESERVERS=synapse.m.localhost \
./lk-jwt-service
```
